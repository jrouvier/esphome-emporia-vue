# Protocol details

Each message sent or received begins with a `$` (hex 24).  Messages end with a carrage return (`\r` / hex 0D).

### Message types

| Msg char | Hex value | Description |
| -------- | --------- | ----------- |
| r        |  0x72  | Get meter reading |
| j        |  0x6a  | Join the meter |
| m        |  0x6d  | Get mac address (of the MGM111)|
| i        |  0x69  | Get install code |
| f        |  0x66  | Get firmware version |

## Sending messages

Messages from the ESP to the MGM111 have just the previously mentioned `$` starting delimiter, then a message type character and the 
ending `\r` delimiter.  Each message is therefore exactly 3 bytes long.  For example, to get the a mac address, send the hex bytes
`24 6D 0D` (`$m\r`)

## Receiving responses

Response format bytes:

|  0 |  1 |  2 |  3 | ... | x |
| -- | -- | -- | -- | --- | - |
| `$` | 0x01 | *\<msg type\>* | *\<payload length\>* | *\<payload\>...* | `\r` |

Byte 1, 0x01 indicates that this is a response
Byte 2 is the same messages type that was used to trigger this response
Byte 3 is the length of the payload that follows
Bytes 4+ are the payload of the response
The final byte is the terminator

Ex:  
`24 01 6D 08 11 22 33 44 55 66 77 88 0D`

#### Mac address response payload
The mac address reponse bytes are in reverse order, if the device responds with `11 22 33 44 55 66 77 88` then the mac address is
`88:77:66:55:44:33:22:11`

#### Install code response payload
The install code bytes are also swapped, see mac address response above

#### Meter reading response payload

| Bytes | Meaning |
| ----- | ------- |
| 0 - 3 | Unknown, usually zeros |
| 4 - 8 | Watt hours consumed.  Sometimes an invalid number greater than `0x0040 0000` is returned, which is not well understood |
| 9 - 45 | Unknown, seems to always be zeros |
| 46 - 50 | Unknown, seems to typically be `0x0000 0001` |
| 51 - 55 | Potentially a Watt-Hour to kWh divisor, typically `0x0000 0x03E8` (1000) |
| 56 - 60 | Current watts being consumed |
| 61+ | Unknown |
